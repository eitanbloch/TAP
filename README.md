# TAP - Task Assistance Planning

In task assistance planning, we are given two robots Rtask and Rassist. The first robot, Rtask, is in charge of performing a given task by executing a precomputed path. The second robot, Rassist, is in charge of assisting the task performed by Rtask using on-board sensors. The ability of Rassist to provide assistance to Rtask depends on the locations of both robots. Since Rtask is moving along its path, Rassist may also need to move to provide as much assistance as possible. The problem we study is how to compute a path for Rassist so as to maximize the portion of Rtaskâ€™s path for which assistance is provided.

This repo provides the code from the paper: [On the Algorithmic Foundations of Task Assistance Planning](https://crl.cs.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TAP.pdf).

## Usage


An example using the code is provided in the file `example.cpp`. The example runs the Branch and Bound, DFS-OTP and Delta discretization algorithms on roadmaps generated using the simulation environment used in the paper (Fig. 4). 

Additional graphs generated by the simulation can be found in the `graphs` folder.

You can compile the code by running the following command:

```bash
make TAP
```

You can run the code by running the following command:

```bash
./TAP
```
